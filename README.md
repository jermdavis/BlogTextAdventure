# Blog Text Adventure Example

A very simple text adventure built as an example for <a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/textadventure-world" target="_blank">a blog series I'm working through</a>.

## Projects:

* AdventureEngine - a library with core code and classes for building simple text Adventure games. 
* ExampleTextAdventure - an example text Adventure console app built using AdventureEngine

## Running it

Should work anywhere .Net 10 is installed.

* From a console in the solution folder (locally or in the CodeSpace Terminal pane) run `cd ExampleTextAdventure` and then `dotnet run` to start the game.
* In Visual Studio, set `ExampleTextAdventure` as the startup project and run this in a console window.
* In VS Code (locally or in a CodeSpace) use the "Run and debug" tab to start with the `.Net Core Launch (console)` settings to start the game in the Terminal pane.
